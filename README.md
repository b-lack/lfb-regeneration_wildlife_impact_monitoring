## Development Installation

For the installation from the repository ``pb_tool`` must be installed. For this follow the instructions in [pb_tool.cfg](pb_tool.cfg).

After making sure you have installed pb_tool, you can deploy the cloned plugin to your QGIS plugins folder:

```bash
$ pb_tool deploy
```
The plugin will be copied to your QGIS plugins folder.

QGIS: ``Settings`` -> ``User Profiles`` -> ``Open Active Profile Folder`` -> ``python`` -> ``plugins``

At this point you should restart QGIS.

### Activate Plugin
